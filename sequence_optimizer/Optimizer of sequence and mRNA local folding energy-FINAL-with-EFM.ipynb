    "            Codons with available tRNA are considered more optimal: More codon-recognizing tRNAs in the cell results in \n",
    "            faster translation elongation for the codon. The index uses estimation of tRNA pool to assess the\n",
    "            weights of each codon (Tuller et.al. 2010). \n",
    "        - NTE (normalized translation efficiency): This measure is an improvement of the previous approach for\n",
    "            estimating codon optimality, by considering not only the supply of tRNA but also the demand, i.e. the number\n",
    "            of codons and mRNA copies that needs to be translated by the same tRNA. \n",
    "            For each codon, the NTE index is defined as the normalized supply/demand ratio.  \n",
    "        - TDR (typical decoding rate): for each codon, this empirical measure is defined as  \"1/codon decoding time\", \n",
    "            where the codon decoding time is based on a new analysis method of ribosomal profiling data \n",
